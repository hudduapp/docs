# Events

#### Events are a means to ingest data into our system.

Events work as follows:

1. an event is sent
2. if the event has been sent before a reference is made to the bespoke event, otherwise a reference to that event is made
3. Events are displayed in diverse ways on the dashboard

Note that events are saved across an account **NOT PROJECT.** Thus if an event is modified on the dashboard, that is going to affect the same events from different projects.
