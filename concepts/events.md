# Events

#### The idea

Events are a means to specify how data should be added to _Huddus event entries_ database.

#### Publishing events

Events can be published via the **ingest API** (at [ingest.huddu.io](https://ingest.huddu.io)). If possible we recommend using a clientside SDK for publishing to the SDK.

&#x20;The ingest API is not well documented at this point however, you can use the autogenerated Swagger documentation at [https://ingest.huddu.io/docs](https://ingest.huddu.io/docs) if you want.

#### Schemas

The first time an event is sent a schema gets created based on how the sent data looks. All following event entries **have to match** that exact schema.

The reasoning behind this is that components expect a certain schema from the data they visualize, so in order to make sure that schema is met events are validated before being saved.

A schema can look something like this:

```json
{
    "<fieldname>": {
        "description": 0,
        "type": "str"
    }
    ...
}
```

#### Event flow inside Huddu

After being registered events run through a few validation steps, before finally being saved to the project's dataset. This process can take a minute or two.
