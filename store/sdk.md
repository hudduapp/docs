# SDK

The Huddu SDK is the simplest way to create key, value pairs on Huddu. As of now only one language (namely python) is supported with plans for nodejs and java to follow suit soon!

Any languages to add to that list? Tell us in a [community channel!](../other/community.md)

## Installation

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Python" %}
```
pip install huddu
```

{% hint style="info" %}
It's great practice to keep all your requirements in a requirements.txt file!
{% endhint %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
