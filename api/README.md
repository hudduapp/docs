# API

This documentation for our data-api allowing users to create new dashboards, series, and series entries via the API. As of now our API is very much in alpha and is due to change quite often.

Please note that we offer a variety of clientside SKDs in python, nodejs and go, so you don't have to deal with the API directly.

If possible we suggest you use the SDKs over our API, if you decide to use our API nonetheless you can find documentation generated via the openapi spec in the subpages.



**Good Luck** :thumbsup:****
