# API

The API can be accessed at **https://api.huddu.io**



This is the documentation for our public data-api which allows users to create new dashboards, series, and series entries programmatically. As of now our API is very much in alpha and is **due to change** quite often.

Please note that we offer a variety of clientside SKDs in python, node js, and go, so you don't have to deal with the API directly.

If possible we suggest you use the SDKs over our API, if you decide to use our API nonetheless you can find documentation generated via the openapi spec in the subpages.



**Good Luck** :thumbsup:****
