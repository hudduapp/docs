# Speedrun Huddu

Have a project you want to monitor using Huddu? This is the right place! If you get stuck at any point please feel free to join our community&#x20;

#### First, let's get a few basic things out of the way:

1. Create an account at [https://huddu.io/](https://huddu.io/) and go to the dashboard
2. Create a fresh project (you only need to give it a memorable name)
3. In the project create a new stream, you will be prompted with a dialog asking if you want to create a new connector
4. Create the bespoke new connector (make sure to check the required scopes. In this case, we want to only publish events to a stream, so choosing **create\_events** should be sufficient)
5. After creating the connector, you should be able to copy a token, make sure you do as you won't see it ever again.

#### Implementing Code

Next, we need to publish our events via the Huddu API. The following shows an example of doing so using Python, if you're using a different language, please check the SDKs page.

1. Let's create a client and set a few variables

```python
from huddu import ApiClient
cl = ApiClient("<connector_api_key>")

project_id = "<project_id>"  
stream_id = "<stream_id>"  
account_id = "<account_id>"  
event_id = "<event_id>"  
```

2\. Let's now create 10 events containing some data

```python
for i in range(0,10):
        res = client.Events.create(
                account=account_id,
                project=project_id,
                stream=stream_id,
                data="some data; run"+i,
            )
        )
```

#### Getting the data again

Lets now attempt to retrieve the data we sent again.

```python
print(
    client.Events.search(
        project=project_id,
        account=account_id,
        stream=stream_id,
        query={"data": {"$regex": "some data;"}},
    )
)
```

If you just want to retrieve the latest entries you could also just use the Events.list method however, this way we can filter our results as well.
